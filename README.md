Read the Word of God + the Apocrypha from your terminal!

**NOTE:** As of May 8, 2020, the "Colour Update" has been released.
Because of this, if you read certain parts of the Bible using `less`, they *may* appear incorrectly formatted.
If you do not have your `$PAGER` environmental variable manually set, then there should be **NO** issue whatsoÃ«ver.
But, if you do, you may need to either add it to a dot-file that is executed at login and/or also run `export PAGER="less -R"`.

Forked from [https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/kjv.git](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/kjv.git), which is forked from [https://github.com/bontibon/kjv.git](https://github.com/bontibon/kjv.git) but with the Apocrypha added.

Smith added the apocrypha and made a better Makefile, however, I have rebranded it as "kjva," meaning kjv+apocyrpha, to avoid confusion with the original by bontibon, and have added a "-w" option, over the "-W."

The master (kjva) now has all of the forewords to the Psalms that had them--when the KJV translators were translating Bible, they were allowed to modify the versification *if* absolutely necessary;
they exercised this right in the Psalms by making the headers for each Psalm not a verse--many people often mistake these as not being scripture, but are technically scripture.
They do nothing more than explain both or either of who wrote the psalm or what its purpose is.

I also added the Hebrew Alephbet to the Psalm 119, and added a few extra verses (0-0u) that explain how to pronounce the names of the letters in Tiberian Hebrew pronunciation.

Branches
--------

I am adding branches as I make them, to download these, use:

    git clone https://github.comf/Matthew-Tate-Scarbrough/kjva.git --branch <branch name>

Current list of branches:

    lut - Martin Luther's 1545 Bible
    kjv - KJV-pure, without the questionable Apocrypha


Recommendation
--------------

I recommend when using multiple language texts in your terminal that you use a monospace font that support multiple languages; the FSF's FreeMono has almost 4,200 unique glyphs and their FreeSerif--almost 10,600 (though it's not mono-space).

You may also want to look fonts in a specific desired language.

You will need to set your pager to `less -R`, otherwise it will not print correctly.


Usage
-----

    usage: ./kjva [flags] [reference...]

      -l      list books
      -w      no line wrap
      -W      no line wrap (same as -w)
      -h      show help

      Reference types:
          <Book>
              Individual book
          <Book>:<Chapter>
              Individual chapter of a book
          <Book>:<Chapter>:<Verse>[,<Verse>]...
              Individual verse(s) of a specific chapter of a book
          <Book>:<Chapter>-<Chapter>
              Range of chapters in a book
          <Book>:<Chapter>:<Verse>-<Verse>

          <Book>:<Chapter>/<Search>
              All verses in a chapter of a book that match a pattern


Build
-----

I recommend creating a folder in your ~/Downloads, called ~/Downloads/.src for all source code; if you plan on using other people's forks of a particular software, like bontibon's "kjv," then make a subfolder appropriately named.

    mkdir ~/Downloads/.src
    mkdir ~/Downloads/.src/cmd-bibles

Now, clone kjva's repository and then run make:

    git clone https://github.com/Matthew-Tate-Scarbrough/kjva.git ~/Downloads/.src/cmd-bibles/kjva
    cd ~/Downloads/.src/cmd-bibles/kjva
    sudo make install

For the Luther 1545 branch, do:

    git clone https://github.com/Matthew-Tate-Scarbrough/kjva.git --branch lut ~/Downloads/.src/cmd-bibles/lut
    cd ~/Downloads/.src/cmd-bibles/lut
    sudo make install

For the KJV-Pure branch, do:

    git clone https://github.com/Matthew-Tate-Scarbrough/kjva.git --branch kjv ~/Downloads/.src/cmd-bibles/kjv-mts
    cd ~/Downloads/.src/cmd-bibles/kjv-mts
    sudo make install
